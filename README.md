### Division of Labor
Due to the nature of this assignment much of the labor was completed in person with all members present for the first portions of the project. In order to learn and gain practice we met frequently and bouced ideas off of each other while trying our own approaches and meeting back to land on what we considered to be the best take. 

In each group meeting we all mapped out what we wanted to do and discussed how we wanted to divide everything up.
We often met to work off of one machine because it was just easier with everone present given the nature of working on a fragile kernel.
We worked as a group implementing part 1 entirely in person. For part two, we each developed our own version so we could all use that as a learning expreince and then we met up and finished it together in a group coding session. For part three, we took a more careful approach and worked together to carefully plan exactly how we wanted to tackle it and worked to implement the different sections step by step making sure to snapshot and not step on each others toes all remoting in to the same machine to work. 

All members rate all other members a 10/10 would group again.

### Git commit log

The git commit log is inluded as a .txt file within the tar.

### Assessment of each task/section & known bugs

#### Part 1:

No known issues or bugs.

#### Part 2:

No known issues or bugd.

#### Part 3:

To Do: Fill in issues ro bugs with part 3 before final submission.

### EXTRA CREDIT

We are attempting to get out algorithm in the top five of the class to recieve the extra credit.
